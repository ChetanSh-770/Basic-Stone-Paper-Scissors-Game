# Basic-Stone-Paper-Scissors-Game
As the name suggests it is a simple game of stone, paper and scissors just to execute basic python theories

Features:
1. Simple and easy to understand.
2. Clear output displaying choices and results.
3. Keeps track of the score.
4. Uses ASCII art for a more engaging experience.
5. Includes input validation to handle incorrect user input.
6. Handles potential errors gracefully (e.g., non-integer input).
7. Corrected the tie logic to accurately reflect scores.

Future Improvements:
1. Could add a "best of" feature (e.g., play until someone wins a certain number of rounds).
2. Explore different ways to represent the choices (e.g., using strings instead of integers).
3. Potentially add a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more visually appealing game.
